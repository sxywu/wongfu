Now, Dateh has teamed up with guitarist Ken Belcher to create The Good Life  a concept record that offers a fresh and original take on acoustic urban folk music.\r\n\r\nThe Good Life is a seven-song EP that follows the life of a man living out his adulthood. Classic, well-known stories of finding happiness in each moment and the search for love are presented in new ways with Datehs pure voice and lush string harmonies filling in the lines while Belcher punctuates each sentence with the soulful strumming of guitar.\r\n\r\nBeing fully trained in both Classical and Jazz styles, Paul Dateh & Ken Belchers influences are extremely diverse. Some of their influences include Bela Fleck, Stephane Grappelli, Alan & Marilyn Bergman, Stevie Wonder, and The Clientele.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the release of The Good Life, Dateh and Belcher have been touring throughout the United States performing to sold-out crowds while also continuing to build a solid following online. The duo also made their first five-week tour in Japan in November of 2009.", "published": "2010-01-08T00:46:46.000Z", "images": ["http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1yLvQ6grjhs/0.jpg", "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1yLvQ6grjhs/1.jpg", "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1yLvQ6grjhs/2.jpg", "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1yLvQ6grjhs/3.jpg"]}, {"associations": [], "rating": {"count": 936, "average": 4.794872}, "title": "Paul Dateh & The Smule Magic Fiddle", "views": "111926", "comments": 167, "content": "Turn your iPad into a violin with \"Magic Fiddle\"!\nAvailable on the iTunes App Store: http://bit.ly/smulemagicfiddle  \n\nThe cool people over at Smule asked me to make a video with their new Magic Fiddle app. After 3.5 hours of playing around with the app, here's what I came up with.
